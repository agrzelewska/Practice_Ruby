# Your task is to escape from the carpark using only the staircases provided to reach the exit.
# You may not jump over the edge of the levels (youâ€™re not Superman!) and the exit is always
# on the far right of the ground floor.
# Rules
#    1. You are passed the carpark data as an argument into the function.
#    2. Free carparking spaces are represented by a 0
#    3. Staircases are represented by a 1
#    4. Your parking place (start position) is represented by a 2
#    5. The exit is always the far right element of the ground floor.
#    6. You must use the staircases to go down a level.
#    7. You will never start on a staircase.
#    8. The start level may be any level of the car park.
#    9. Each floor will have only one staircase apart from the ground floor which
#       will not have any staircases.
